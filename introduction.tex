\section*{Introduction}
 
This assignment is completed using antlr in the console, and not in eclipse. It is expected that the reader knows the original content of WhileLanguage.g, as it would be too pedantic to go through all details of the code during explanations. Some CFL variables may depicted with several letters, so in order to not confuse variable names, all subsequent variables will have a space between them.
